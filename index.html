      <h1>What Does It Mean to Write a History of India?</h1>

      Every generation rewrites India’s past—not because the past changes, but because the questions we ask of it do.
    </p>

    <p>
      Writing a history of India is not the same as listing events in chronological order. It involves decisions about geography, language, sources, and scale. The subcontinent predates the modern nation-state by centuries, and any attempt to narrate its past must confront this tension.
    </p>

    <p>
      Historians rely on surviving materials: inscriptions, court records, travel accounts, administrative documents, and literary texts. What survives often reflects power—who had the resources to record their world, and whose lives were considered worth preserving.
    </p>

    <h2>History as Method</h2>

    <p>
      Audrey Truschke’s book <em>India</em> offers one way of approaching this problem. Rather than presenting a civilizational essence, it focuses on how evidence is read and interpreted. Persian chronicles, for example, are treated not as neutral accounts but as texts shaped by political contexts.
    </p>

    <p>
      This approach unsettles readers who expect history to confirm inherited narratives. Academic distance can feel like detachment, and textual analysis can seem to erase lived memory. Yet this discomfort reveals a deeper conflict about what history is supposed to do.
    </p>

    <hr />

    <p>
      Perhaps the question is not whether a single history of India is correct, but why we continue to search for one. The persistence of disagreement suggests that history functions less as a settled account and more as an ongoing argument about meaning, authority, and memory.
